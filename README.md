# MyAnimeList-Dark-Mode
 MAL Dark Mode
 
This Extension is provided as a learning tool only as I have no intention of finishing it, posting it to chrome/firefox or MAL, or providing any more commits to it after this one, it's compatable with Chrome, Firefox and Opera and showcases jQuery, options menu, color picker and slider, and I figured since this was a "team" project that had been waiting for Shishio-kun to finish the CSS V.L provided me, I updated, then slimmed down from 10,000 to 6,000 lines, V.L then slimmed it down to about 3,000 lines and Shishio-kun did an amazing job at organizing and getting it to 1,600 lines.

Any further updates Shishio-kun or I make to our other side projects will not be included.
